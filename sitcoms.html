            Six young men and women live in the same apartment complex and face life and 
            love together in Manhattan, New York City. As they're constantly sticking their noses 
            into each another's businesses, as well as sometimes swapping romantic partners, 
            the group always get into the kind of comic situations that most other people never 
            experience, especially during breakups.

            Mensa-fied best friends and roommates Leonard and Sheldon, physicists who work at the 
            California Institute of Technology, may be able to tell everybody more than they want to 
            know about quantum physics, but getting through most basic social situations, especially 
            ones involving women, totally baffles them. How lucky, then, that babe-alicious 
            waitress/aspiring actress Penny moves in next door. Frequently seen hanging out with Leonard 
            and Sheldon are friends and fellow Caltech scientists Wolowitz and Koothrappali. 
            Will worlds collide? Does Einstein theorize in the woods?
